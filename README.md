For this project, which I completed for my baseball stats course at Quinnipiac, I compared Mark Teixeira to Frank Thomas, a Hall of Fame first baseman, to determine if Mark Teixeira should be in the Hall of Fame. Based on Teixeira's stats and tests such as Hall of Fame Standards Test and Similarity Test, I do not believe that Mark Teixeira should be in the Hall of Fame. He was a very good player, but not great enough to be in the Hall of Fame.
